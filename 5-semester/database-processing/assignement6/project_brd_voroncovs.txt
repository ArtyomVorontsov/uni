Business Requirements & Analysis (BRD)

1. Scenario Overview

Platform Name
StreamNova – a subscription-based video streaming platform.

Service Description
StreamNova provides on-demand access to movies, TV series, and exclusive original content. Users subscribe on a monthly basis using one of several plans (Basic, Standard, Premium), each offering different video quality, number of concurrent devices, and access to premium content. Users can watch content across web, mobile, and smart TV devices.

The platform operates globally and relies heavily on recurring subscription revenue. User engagement (how often and how long users watch content) is a key indicator of customer satisfaction and retention.

Key Business Stakeholders
CFO / Finance Team – monitors revenue, discounts, refunds, and overall financial performance.
Head of Product – evaluates engagement with content and features to guide roadmap decisions.
Marketing Manager – analyzes trials, conversions, promotions, and churn trends.
Customer Success / Retention Team – tracks churn, downgrades, and inactive users.
Data / Analytics Team – ensures data quality and reliability for decision-making.

Purpose of the Monthly Report
The Monthly Performance & Engagement Report helps management:

* Understand revenue trends and the health of the subscription base.
* Measure how actively subscribers are using the service.
* Detect churn risks, plan changes, and trial conversions.
* Identify potential data quality issues that could distort KPIs.

The report is designed to be run directly in Oracle using PL/SQL and DBMS_OUTPUT.

4. Assumptions & Constraints

* One active subscription per user at a time.
* Revenue is recognized at payment date.
* Engagement is measured only through recorded viewing sessions.
* The report focuses on a single selected month.
* Data volume is small enough to be processed via PL/SQL with DBMS_OUTPUT for educational purposes.

This BRD forms the foundation for schema design, sample data creation, and the final PL/SQL reporting script.
