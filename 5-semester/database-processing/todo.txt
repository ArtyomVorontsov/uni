TODO: 

1. Database Schema (DDL Script)
* DONE - Create tables for managing events, ticket types, customer orders, order lines, and an audit log.
* DONE - Define appropriate primary keys, foreign keys, data types, and constraints.
* DONE - Ensure referential integrity between related entities (e.g., orders linked to events and ticket types).
* Use meaningful column names and comments to describe the purpose of each table.

2. Sample Data (DML Script)
* DONE - Insert at least two events, each with multiple ticket types and defined capacities.
* DONE - Insert at least three orders with various ticket line items that represent valid and boundary cases (e.g., near-capacity, insufficient capacity).
* DONE - Include data that can be used to test both valid and invalid operations triggered by your business rules.


3. Trigger Logic (PL/SQL Script)
* DONE - Implement AUDIT_LOG Logging significant changes (insert, update, delete) into an audit table.
* Implement database triggers to maintain consistency and enforce business rules such as:
    * DONE - Preventing the sale of tickets that exceed the available capacity.
    * DONE - Automatically calculating totals for order lines and overall order amounts.
    * DONE - Logging significant changes (insert, update, delete) into an audit table.
* Triggers must operate correctly on multi-row operations.
* Include clear comments explaining the purpose, timing, and scope of each trigger.
* Do not use commits or autonomous transactions inside triggers.

4. Audit Logging
* DONE - Design a general-purpose audit table to record who made a change, when it occurred, which table was affected, and the action performed.
* DONE - All triggers must insert relevant details into this audit table when DML occurs on key entities.

* Test all triggers
